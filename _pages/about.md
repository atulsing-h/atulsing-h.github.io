I am a recent graduate of urban planning from the School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada and have been currently engaged as an RA at IIMB's economics area.

My research interests have evolved at the intersection of planning, environment and economics - with primary interest in studying pollution problems. The thread of my demonstratable experience flows between sustainable transport planning, economics of the environment, air pollution modelling and development outcomes.

Feel free to reach me on my LinkedIn or email!
